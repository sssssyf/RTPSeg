# RTPSeg
RTPSeg: A Multi-Modality Dataset for LiDAR Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation Assisted with RGB-Thermal Images

To bridge the research gap and promote in-depth research, we introduce RTPSeg, the first and only dataset comprising RGB and TIR images for 3D semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. RTPSeg fills the void of a specialized dataset and establishes itself as a novel benchmark, presenting considerable challenges and opportunities to existing approaches.
